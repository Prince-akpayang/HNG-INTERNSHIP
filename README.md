# Internship Repository: Data Analysis and Reporting

## Overview

Welcome to my internship repository, which contains all the tasks and projects I completed during my internship. The repository includes a range of assignments focusing on data analysis, report generation, and the application of statistical techniques using R. 

## Structure

- **Data Analysis**: Scripts and reports on analyzing datasets, cleaning data, and generating insights.
- **Reports**: HTML and PDF reports summarizing findings, trends, and recommendations from data analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Code for generating visual insights using ggplot2 and other libraries.
- **Documentation**: Readme files, project descriptions, and setup instructions for each task.
- **Scripts**: R scripts for tasks such as data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## Key Projects

1. **Facebook Metrics Analysis**: 
   - Analyzing Facebook post metrics, identifying top-performing posts, and providing insights on engagement patterns.
   - Key tasks: Data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and report generation.
   
2. **Customer Segmentation (if applicable)**:
   - Task involving clustering or segmentation of customers based on provided datasets.
   - Tasks included preprocessing, running clustering algorithms, and providing actionable insights for marketing teams.

3. **Time Series Forecasting (if applicable)**:
   - Applied time series techniques to predict future sales or trends from historical data.
   - Key tasks included data preprocessing, model fitting, and forecasting with accuracy evaluations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   ```

2. Set up the R environment:
   - Install necessary libraries: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and any others specified in the `setup.R` script.
   - Run the scripts to analyze different datasets or generate reports.

3. Explore the reports in the **Reports** folder. Each report provides insights based on the corresponding analysis script.

## Technologies Used

- **R**: will be mostly used here.
